# ðŸ’Š Agentic AI Assistant for Pharmaceutical Research

## Overview
This project is an **Agentic AI Assistant** designed to support pharmaceutical research.  
Researchers can query a multi-agent AI backend to get insights on **drug discovery**, **clinical trial analysis**, and **drug-drug interactions**.  

The system routes queries to specialized agents, returns step-by-step analysis, visuals (dummy graphs/charts), and research recommendations.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**
  - **Coordinator Agent**: Parses queries and delegates to specialized agents.
  - **Drug Discovery Agent**: Analyzes molecular structures and predicts drug-target interactions.
  - **Clinical Trial Analysis Agent**: Validates trial designs, analyzes sample data, and recommends patient cohorts.
  - **Drug Interaction Agent**: Detects drug-drug interactions and suggests dosage adjustments.

- **Interactive Query Handling**
  - Agents can ask follow-up questions to clarify queries.
  - Step-by-step reasoning is included in responses.

- **Visual Outputs**
  - Graphs, molecular charts, and interaction diagrams (dummy visuals for demonstration).

- **Persistent Chat History**
  - Stores all conversations in a database for review and auditing.

- **Streaming Responses**
  - Responses are streamed progressively to simulate a real-time AI assistant.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- **AI Agent Framework**: Agno / PydanticAI (dummy logic in this prototype)
- **Database**: SQLite / Any preferred relational DB
- **Containerization**: Docker (optional)
- **Frontend (Optional)**: Streamlit for chat interface
